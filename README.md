# Oracle23c Examples

To get this note book working you'll need to do the following steps

* install the listed requirements.txt with pip. I suggets you do this in a virtualenv setup.
* Create an Oracle user with the script supplied. This should step will be added to a notebook in the future
* You'll also need to install Oracle ORDS and configure that. Add a connection pool for the user you just created

Things to do

* Add images and additional text to examples.
* Add a helper notebook (i.e. create user) with instructions on how to run the notebook.
* Add additional Oracle 23c examples
* Create a dockerfile to build an image that can be trivially shared with people
