# Oracle23c Examples

To get this note book working you'll need to do the following steps

* install the listed requirements.txt with pip. I suggets you do this in a virtualenv setup.
* You should have installed Oracle ORDS and configured that against your target database.
* Use the ```Setup``` notebook to create an Oracle user to run the scripts.


Things to do

* Add images and additional text to examples.
~~* Add a helper notebook (i.e. create user) with instructions on how to run the notebook.~~
* Add additional Oracle 23c examples
* Create a dockerfile to build an image that can be trivially shared with people
